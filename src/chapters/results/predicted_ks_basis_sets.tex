As our differentiable basis set framework lets us differentiate through the whole basis set fitting procedere, we can choose to replace the constant basis functions that are commonly used in DFT calculation with adaptive ones which can adopt to the local chemical environment. First approaches in this direction were done by .... and recently with the rise of machine learing approches Linear fitted coefficient (...) and by a gaussian process predicted coefficients have been tried out. Adaptive exponents inside the Gaussian basis functions have been avoided so far as they require to differentiate through the integrals. But now owr framework allows us to to learn the coefficients and exponents used in dft calculations jointly. We mainly restrict our analysis to minimal basis sets as they are exspected to profit the most from these improvements.
