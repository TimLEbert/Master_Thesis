Aside from the applied density fitting method also the osed orbital free basis set has an aguably even larger effect on the accuracy of the density fitted density.
The often used even tempered besis set are an reliable, when also inefficient way to define an orbital free bassis set. Their simple construction algorith\cite{cosnt} covers the space of possible densities very broadly without.
To improve the performance of our orbital free basis set it makes sense to use ab basis set which offers a higher  resolution in regions where densities fluctuate more rapitly.
We construct this improved basis by starting with an even tempered one and used differentiable integrals and autograd to .

\section{Using differentiable integrals to optimize an orbital free basis set}
The basis density fitting formulation which minimizes the L2 norm of the residual density is given by:
The following Lagragien describes the residula density
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{L}[\rho] &= \min_{\rho'}\left(||\rho-\rho'||_{\text{L2}}\right)\\
    &=
\end{align}
