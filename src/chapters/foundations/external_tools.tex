All plots, if not meantioned otherwise, were created by me using the python library matplotlib\cite{hunter_matplotlib_2007}. I used the Large Language models Chatgpt\cite{openai_chatgpt_2024}, Claude\cite{anthropic_claude_2024} and Copilot\cite{github_copilot_2023} for finding references, helping me paraphrase sentences and checking spelling and grammar.
