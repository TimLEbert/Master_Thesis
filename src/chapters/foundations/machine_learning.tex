\section{Graph Neural Networks}
Graph neural networks are a special Variant of Neural networks that apply to graph shaped data.
In our case the graph is the molecular structure of the system that we want to model. Each atom functions as a node in the graph which contains information about the local density around this atom in form of the coefficients of the basis function that centered on the atom. The Edges of the graph contain information in form of the distance towards the next atom. These distances can be embedded in the edge features of the graph neural network.
