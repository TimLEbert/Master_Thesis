This section introduces the fundamentals necessary to understand the following chapters. It is divided into four parts. First, we present the basics of basis functions for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which are essential for discretizing theoretical formulations into machine-solvable equations. Secondly, we introduce the foundations of DFT, focusing on Kohn-Sham DFT (KS-DFT), followed by the mechanics of Orbital-Free DFT (OF-DFT) formulation. This includes descriptions of how OF-DFT labels are computed for machine learning models, which are introduced in the final section of the methods chapter.
