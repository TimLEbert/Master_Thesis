This section introduces the fundamentals that are neccesary to understand the following chapters. The section is divided into four parts. First the Density functional theory is introduced, followed by the orbital free DFT formulation. The third part introduces the basis sets that are used in DFT calculations. The last part introduces machine learning and the graphformer model that is used in this thesis.




Methods:
Density functional theory and speciffically kohn sham
Basis sets GTOs and PAOs and their integrals. typical basis sets
Orbital free dft formulation basis sets even tempered, density fitting 
Machine learing
Graphformer  Message passing Graph neural network
