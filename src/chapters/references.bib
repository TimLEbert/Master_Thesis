	shorttitle = {M-{OFDFT}},
	abstract = {Orbital-free density functional theory ({OFDFT}) is a quantum chemistry formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham {DFT}, which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. In this work, we propose {MOFDFT}, an {OFDFT} approach capable of solving molecular systems using a deep-learning functional model. We build the essential nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-{OFDFT} achieves a comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham {DFT} on a wide range of molecules untouched by {OFDFT} before. More attractively, M-{OFDFT} extrapolates well to molecules much larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier in quantum chemistry.},

	abstract = {It is chemically intuitive that an optimal atom centered basis set must adapt to its atomic environment, for example by polarizing toward nearby atoms. Adaptive basis sets of small size can be significantly more accurate than traditional atom centered basis sets of the same size. The small size and well conditioned nature of these basis sets leads to large saving in computational cost, in particular in a linear scaling framework. Here, it is shown that machine learning can be used to predict such adaptive basis sets using local geometrical information only. As a result, various properties of standard {DFT} calculations can be easily obtained at much lower costs, including nuclear gradients. In our approach, a rotationally invariant parametrization of the basis is obtained by employing a potential anchored on neighboring atoms to ultimately construct a rotation matrix that turns a traditional atom centered basis set into a suitable adaptive basis set. The method is demonstrated using {MD} simulations of liquid water, where it is shown that minimal basis sets yield structural properties in fair agreement with basis set converged results, while reducing the computational cost in the best case by a factor of 200 and the required flops by 4 orders of magnitude. Already a very small training set yields satisfactory results as the variational nature of the method provides robustness.},

	abstract = {Electronic structure calculations on small systems such as H2, H2O, {LiH}, and {BeH}2 with chemical accuracy are still a challenge for the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) devices. One of the reasons is that due to the device limitations, only minimal basis sets are commonly applied in quantum chemical calculations, which allows one to keep the number of qubits employed in the calculations at a minimum. However, the use of minimal basis sets leads to very large errors in the computed molecular energies as well as potential energy surface shapes. One way to increase the accuracy of electronic structure calculations is through the development of small basis sets better suited for quantum computing. In this work, we show that the use of adaptive basis sets, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on molecular structure, provides an easy way to dramatically improve the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations without the need to increase the basis set size and thus the number of qubits utilized in quantum circuits. As a proof of principle, we optimize an adaptive minimal basis set for quantum computing calculations on an H2 molecule, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on the HH distance, and apply it to the generation of H2 potential energy surface on {IBM}-Q quantum devices. The adaptive minimal basis set reaches the accuracy of the double-zeta basis sets, thus allowing one to perform double-zeta quality calculations on quantum devices without the need to utilize twice as many qubits in simulations. This approach can be extended to other molecular systems and larger basis sets in a straightforward manner.},
