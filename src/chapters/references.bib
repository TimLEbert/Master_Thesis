	abstract = {Orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) is a quantum chemistry formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham DFT, which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. In this work, we propose MOFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular systems using a deep-learning functional model. We build the essential nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier in quantum chemistry.},

	abstract = {Many low-cost or semiempirical quantum mechanical-based electronic structure methods suffer from the use of unpolarized minimal atomic orbital (AO) basis sets. In this work, we overcome this limitation by a fully DFT variationally optimized, adaptive minimal basis set consistently available for the elements up to radon (Z = 86). The new key feature is to make the linear coefficients of the primitive Gaussians in a contracted AO dependent on the effective atomic charge of the atom in the molecule, i.e., each symmetry-unique atom obtains its “own” specifically adapted basis functions. In this way, the physically important “breathing” of the AOs in a molecule with (a) atomic charge (expansion/contraction for anionic/cationic states) and (b) the number of close-lying bonded neighbor atoms is accounted for. The required atomic charges are obtained from a specially developed extended Hückel type Hamiltonian and the coordination numbers from the molecule geometry. Proper analytical derivatives of the resulting adaptive basis functions can easily be derived. Moreover, the basis functions are electric field-dependent, thus improving the description of, e.g., dipole moments and polarizabilities. The new basis set termed q-vSZP (charge dependent valence single-ζ, polarized) is thoroughly benchmarked for atomic/molecular and thermochemical properties compared to standard minimal and double-ζ basis sets at the DFT level with the accurate ωB97X-D4 functional. It is shown that q-vSZP is clearly superior to existing minimal basis sets, often reaching double-ζ quality or even better results. We expect it to be the optimal choice in future semiempirical quantum mechanical methods.},

	abstract = {The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer. The code and models of Graphormer will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Microsoft/Graphormer.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks have recently achieved great successes in predicting quantum mechanical properties of molecules. These models represent a molecule as a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however, consider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional information playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g. in angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional message passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of the atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate space. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since the associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message passing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional information by transforming messages based on the angle between them. Additionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to construct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve better performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis representations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these innovations to construct the directional message passing neural network (DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76\% on MD17 and by 31\% on QM9. Our implementation is available online.},

	abstract = {Electronic structure calculations on small systems such as H2, H2O, LiH, and BeH2 with chemical accuracy are still a challenge for the current generation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. One of the reasons is that due to the device limitations, only minimal basis sets are commonly applied in quantum chemical calculations, which allows one to keep the number of qubits employed in the calculations at a minimum. However, the use of minimal basis sets leads to very large errors in the computed molecular energies as well as potential energy surface shapes. One way to increase the accuracy of electronic structure calculations is through the development of small basis sets better suited for quantum computing. In this work, we show that the use of adaptive basis sets, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on molecular structure, provides an easy way to dramatically improve the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations without the need to increase the basis set size and thus the number of qubits utilized in quantum circuits. As a proof of principle, we optimize an adaptive minimal basis set for quantum computing calculations on an H2 molecule, in which exponents and contraction coefficients depend on the HH distance, and apply it to the generation of H2 potential energy surface on IBM-Q quantum devices. The adaptive minimal basis set reaches the accuracy of the double-zeta basis sets, thus allowing one to perform double-zeta quality calculations on quantum devices without the need to utilize twice as many qubits in simulations. This approach can be extended to other molecular systems and larger basis sets in a straightforward manner.},

	abstract = {It is chemically intuitive that an optimal atom centered basis set must adapt to its atomic environment, for example by polarizing toward nearby atoms. Adaptive basis sets of small size can be significantly more accurate than traditional atom centered basis sets of the same size. The small size and well conditioned nature of these basis sets leads to large saving in computational cost, in particular in a linear scaling framework. Here, it is shown that machine learning can be used to predict such adaptive basis sets using local geometrical information only. As a result, various properties of standard DFT calculations can be easily obtained at much lower costs, including nuclear gradients. In our approach, a rotationally invariant parametrization of the basis is obtained by employing a potential anchored on neighboring atoms to ultimately construct a rotation matrix that turns a traditional atom centered basis set into a suitable adaptive basis set. The method is demonstrated using MD simulations of liquid water, where it is shown that minimal basis sets yield structural properties in fair agreement with basis set converged results, while reducing the computational cost in the best case by a factor of 200 and the required flops by 4 orders of magnitude. Already a very small training set yields satisfactory results as the variational nature of the method provides robustness.},

Such learning is confronted with two key challenges: Giving the model sufficient expressivity and spatial context while limiting the memory footprint to afford computations on a GPU and creating a sufficiently broad distribution of training data to enable iterative density optimization even when starting from a poor initial guess. In response, we introduce KineticNet, an equivariant deep neural network architecture based on point convolutions adapted to the prediction of quantities on molecular quadrature grids. Important contributions include convolution filters with sufficient spatial resolution in the vicinity of nuclear cusp, an atom-centric sparse but expressive architecture that relays information across multiple bond lengths, and a new strategy to generate varied training data by finding ground state densities in the face of perturbations by a random external potential. KineticNet achieves, for the first time, chemical accuracy of the learned functionals across input densities and geometries of tiny molecules.

Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree–Fock level in this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives.

	abstract = {PySCF is a Python-based general-purpose electronic structure platform that supports first-principles simulations of molecules and solids as well as accelerates the development of new methodology and complex computational workflows. This paper explains the design and philosophy behind PySCF that enables it to meet these twin objectives. With several case studies, we show how users can easily implement their own methods using PySCF as a development environment. We then summarize the capabilities of PySCF for molecular and solid-state simulations. Finally, we describe the growing ecosystem of projects that use PySCF across the domains of quantum chemistry, materials science, machine learning, and quantum information science.},
